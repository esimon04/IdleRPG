*make item tooltip appear ON screen only, dynamic

reformat inventory to work with unique item IDs
-made inventory based on itemIds
-changed it to mainly use the item resource instead.
-Items dont save

-Need to either save the modifiers on their own?? In like a seperate array that I load in???
	-added complexity
	+just have to save base item
	
-Or make it so that each item saves itself as a .tres
	-lots of save files in this case. no bueno
	+simpler???
